Hello! My name is Josh and I am a life-sciences student turned software developer. As a child I was smart, sociable, and athletic, a potent combination that opened many doors…I just wasn’t sure which door I wanted to walk through. My interests in health and sciences led me to the life-sciences program at McGill where I studied Pharmacology for a couple reasons: 1) Humans have become utterly dependent on drugs, both recreational and medicinal, and I envision this trend growing stronger as both the population grows and the average lifespan increases; 2) A physician can only help one person at a time while a pharmacologist can help millions of people with the discovery of one drug. Though the decision to study Pharmacology was my own, it was derived rather than desired, coming from a place of logic instead of passion.

While first-year university was relatively easy, second-year took me by surprise. Characterized by smaller class sizes, tougher coursework, and increased competitiveness amongst classmates — this was the first time where I felt the push for the post-graduate hierarchy. My peers were ramping up to their future goals, whereas I didn’t have a goal; I had an idea..maybe a concept of what my life could look like…but definitely no plan. To top it off, a new learning ideology was introduced that still makes my head spin.

The course material transitioned from applying concepts and ideas to the memorization of details, facts, and figures. Come exam season, fellow classmates logged countless hours memorizing the details from each unit, lecture, and slide. Though students knew more, they understood less; this concept made me feel uneasy. From the disconnect I saw between my academic priorities and the sciences methodologies, I understood then that I wouldn’t likely be a part of the scientific field. My experiences in the field, both academic and corporate, left me uninterested and unfulfilled. It is a shame because my interests in health and science still persist today, but my engagement in the field would require a different direction.

Still unsure of what the future held in store for me, I returned home to Vancouver unemployed and unsure what direction my life would take me. Through family I was able to land a position at local IT company despite having little experience with software development. The idea of sitting at a desk all-day didn’t sound like something I would be interested in, but I was wonderfully surprised. The work offered the challenge of solving logic-based problems and the freedom to discover solutions in my own sense — what a treat!

A year and a bit later I am still working for the same IT company and growing into the job. Each day I continue coding and continue learning more about the art of coding. I love the work environment and the freedom that comes with the job, but still I feel like there is more for me to accomplish. Short-term I look to become a better developer with in-demand skills; Long-term I want to return to my interests in health through the software branch. The future of computer science and medicine looks promising and I hope to be a part of it.
